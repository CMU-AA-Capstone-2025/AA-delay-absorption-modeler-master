# AA-delay-absorption-modeler-master
This is the main repository for the 2025 CMU-AA Capstone Project: Flight Delay Absorption Modeling and Analysis. It contains all main data tables, code scripts and reports used or generated during the project.

## Project Content and Analytics Pipeline
This project aims to use open-source, flight-record-related data to construct Machine Learning (ML) models that perform: 
- Classification of whether or not a flight is able to recover departure delay while airborne
- Numerical prediction of the amount of departure delay time that a flight could cover while airborne

The main pipeline from raw data sources to model evaluation outputs is shown in the below figure.
