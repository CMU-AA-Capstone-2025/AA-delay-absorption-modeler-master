# AA-delay-absorption-modeler-master
This is the main repository for the 2025 CMU-AA Capstone Project: Flight Delay Absorption Modeling and Analysis. It contains all main data tables, code scripts and reports used or generated during the project.

## Project Content and Analytics Pipeline
This project aims to use open-source, flight-record-related data to construct Machine Learning (ML) models that perform: 
- Classification of whether or not a flight is able to recover departure delay while airborne
- Numerical prediction of the amount of departure delay time that a flight could cover while airborne

Our workflow for this project is demonstrated in the figure below.

The main pipeline from raw data sources to model evaluation outputs is shown in the figure below. Directories in some code files may not be completely accurate; check thoroughly before execution.
